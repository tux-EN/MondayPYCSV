## Monday Board Exporter 
By: Joshua Gest

This was a small personal project to learn how to play around with monday.com's graphQL API
Input your monday API key and it will pull your board based on the board ID you input in the query on line 19

Currently it only exports to a basic comma-deliminated CSV

**REQUIRES** pandas (pip install pandas) and requests (pip install requests) in order to function

I may eventually make a package but this was just a mess around project.
