Monday Board Exporter 0.1.1 
By: Joshua Gest

This was a small personal project to make something easier in my professional life.
Input your monday API key and it will pull your board based on the board ID you input in the query on line 19

Currently it only exports to a basic comma-deliminated CSV

REQUIRES pandas (pip install pandas) and requests (pip install requests) in order to function
